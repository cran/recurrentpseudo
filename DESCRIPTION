Description: Computation of one-, two- and three-dimensional 
  pseudo-observations based on recurrent events and terminal events. 
  Generalised linear models are fitted using generalised estimating 
  equations. Technical details on the bivariate procedure can be found 
  in "Bivariate pseudo-observations for recurrent event analysis with 
  terminal events" (Furberg et al., 2021) <doi:10.1007/s10985-021-09533-5>.
